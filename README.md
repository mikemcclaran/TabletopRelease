# Tabletop
This repository contains public alpha releases of Tabletop for Meta's XR Hackathon.

# How to Play
## Hardware
Play on Oculus Quest 2 with hand tracking enabled.

## Oculus Release Entitlements
We built our project with Oculus platform integration so that players can see one another's names, etc. Therefore you need to be "entitled" by the Oculus store to run this app on your Oculus Quest.

On your mobile phone with the Oculus app, visit https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4704348299629143 to enroll in our alpha test channel and add the build to your Quest library. Alternatively, you can download the APK directly from the releases section here in this Github repository and sideload it with adb. You will see it in the headset under "Unknown sources" in your list of apps. In that case, you might need to ask us to add your Oculus user to our alpha channel. If you need that, or have any other problems with entitlements while running the game, please email or chat with us (see the Xr Hackathon project page for our contact info).

## Limitations
Please do NOT enter an Oculus party with party chat (or if you must, then please switch to "App" instead of "Party" for your microphone once you are in the app). Party chat conflicts with Wit.ai, but we've notified the Facebook team in the hackathon group and they intend to fix this eventually. This app offers its own built-in voice chat once you connect with your friends (which we only did for now until this conflict is resolved.)

Once you're in the app, only hands are supported, not controllers (just for now in this Hackathon). This is designed as a mostly stationary, sitting experience, so you probably want a stationary guardian and to be in a chair initially, but setup your guardian away from your desk in the middle of a room if you can, so you have plenty of space to reach out across the virtual table.

Just for simplicity during the Hackathon, only 3 players are supported at the moment. More can join, but they won't be positioned properly at the table, so please limit yourself to 3 players at a time in each of your rooms for now.

## Playing
To place items on your table, look directly at Jeeves (the butler). He will give you some help the first time you look at him. Thereafter, look at him and ask him for what you need. For example, say "Give us some dice."

Use Oculus quick settings recenter view to return to your seat at the table at any time.

If you are the only player using the app, you will enter a new room automatically. If you want to join one of your friends who is already in a room, then use the "screen" high up on the right-hand wall and select "Join", then select your friend's room.
