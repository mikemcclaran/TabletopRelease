# Tabletop
This repository contains public alpha releases of Tabletop for Meta's XR Hackathon.

# How to Play
Play on Oculus Quest 2 with hand tracking enabled.

Please do NOT enter an Oculus party with party chat (or if you must, then please switch to "App" instead of "Party" for your microphone once you are in the app). Party chat conflicts with Wit.ai, but we've notified the Facebook team in the hackathon group and they intend to fix this eventually. This app offers its own built-in voice chat once you connect with your friends (which we only did for now until this conflict is resolved.)

Once you're in the app, only hands are supported, not controllers (just for now in this Hackathon). This is designed as a mostly stationary, sitting experience, so you probably want a stationary guardian and to be in a chair initially, but setup your guardian away from your desk in the middle of a room if you can, so you have plenty of space to reach out across the virtual table.

To place items on your table, look directly at Jeeves (the butler). He will give you some help the first time you look at him. Thereafter, look at him and ask him for what you need. For example, say "Give us some dice."

Use Oculus quick settings recenter view to return to your seat at the table at any time.

Just for simplicity during the Hackathon, only 3 players are supported at the moment. More can join, but they won't be positioned properly at the table, so please limit yourself to 3 players at a time in each of your rooms for now.

If you are the only player using the app, you will enter a new room automatically. If you want to join one of your friends who is already in a room, then use the "screen" high up on the right-hand wall and select "Join", then select your friend's room.
